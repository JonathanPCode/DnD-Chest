# DnD Chest
//
// The following program is a simple DND themed inventory system which allows the user
// to give values to items in their own DND runs and see it all listed out in a nice and
// readable format. Our Program requires the user to initally provide the file path for 
//their character which in turn allows the program to write to the file the contents of each
// of its container values and anny descriptions that go along with it. This is also the start where we will take the name and class of the 
// specific character to help keep track for the user which character's inventory we are using . After adding your respective
// containers and trinkets on the GUI side we display the items in the container upon a click interaction.
// Other features proovided include being able to assign  a gold value to each specific container the amount
// of weight it can hold. You can calso add speicfically the value of items in gold as well to keep track in case
// you need to sell your items.
