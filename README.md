D&D Chest ReadMe file


START UP SCREEN:
When you first start the program, the user is asked to either write down their name and class,
or to load up a previous saved file.

If the user wants to load a saved file, they simply have to find the text file in their file 
directory.

After choosing to do either option, the user will press continue and will transition to the 
main screen of the program


MAIN SCREEN:
From here, the user can see their entire inventory, which includes their containers and trinkets.
They can also change the amount of gold that they are carrying as well in the top left, underneath 
their name and class.

They can choose to either add/remove a container or trinket.


CONTAINERS:
Adding a container with the New Container button at on top will give the user the option to name 
the container and give it its set weight limit.
The container has a default name and weight if either is left blank.

After confirming to add the container, the container will be added to the combo box on the left.


TRINKETS:
Then, once the user has a container selected, they can add a trinket with the New Trinket button.
From there, they must to give the trinket a name, its weight, and its value. The description is 
optional.

If the weight of the trinket outweighs how much space the container holds, it will not be added.

Once a trinket is created, it will be added to the selected containers List view, where it can
be selected and viewed more in depth on the right side of the screen.


REMOVING:
Selecting either Remove Trinket or Remove Container will immediantly remove the selected option.
There is no warning, and removing a container will also remove all the items along with it.

SAVING/LOADING:
The Save button will prompt the user to name a text file, and once created will save all the data 
onto the text file.

To load up the save, the user must close the program and go to the start up screen. From there, 
the user should be able to find the save file after selecting the Open File button.

The user does not need to input a name and class, and will load all previous work from that save 
file after selecting Continue.
